## Notes

**Latest Review (2026-02-08):**
- Analyzed coach workflow efficiency and onboarding experience
- Added 3 improvement items to BACKLOG.md:
  1. Coach Dashboard Weekly Summary (High priority - workflow efficiency)
  2. Empty State Onboarding Flow (Medium priority - new user experience)  
  3. Client Progress Quick Actions (High priority - reduce cognitive load)
- Focus was on Journey Completers and Friction Killers for coach daily workflow
- Avoided duplicating UI polish items already in docs/UI-POLISH-PLAN.md
